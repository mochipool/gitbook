# Self-Custody

Web3 is all about putting power back into your hands. Self-custody is a cornerstone value of this new era of the internet, and it means taking personal responsibility for your data and assets.

One way to think of self-custody is like having your own house with a safe. You keep all of your valuables in the safe, and you're the only one who has the combination. This means you don't have to worry about a bank or other intermediary keeping your valuables safe for you. You're in control, and no one can access your valuables without your permission.

There are two main benefits to self-custody:

* **Censorship Resistance**: Governments and other central authorities can't seize or freeze your assets, since they donâ€™t have access to them in the first place. That means your assets are truly yours, and you have the freedom to use them as you wish.
* **Reduced Counterparty Risk**: It eliminates the need for a third party to hold onto your assets or data. This avoids issues with your assets where a custodial service, such as a bank or online platform, goes bankrupt, gets hacked, or engages in fraudulent activity.

Just like you wouldn't give your safe key to someone else, with self-custody, you don't give your assets to anyone else to hold on your behalf. You're the only one who can access them, and you have the power to use them as you see fit.
