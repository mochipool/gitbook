# Digital Ownership

Understanding digital ownership is becoming increasingly important as we move towards a more decentralized and digital world. In the era of the internet and smartphones, ownership is no longer just about tangible assets like land or cars; we now live in a world where digital assets can hold just as much value, if not more.

Currently, when you purchase a song or book digitally, you don’t really own it; you’re simply purchasing a license to access it, or rather its contents, on a platform. You have no control over _**how**_ you use it. With Web3 however, we now have the technology to create unique, verifiable records of digital ownership, and transfer ownership with ease.

For example, you can buy a song or book directly from the creator or another owner digitally, and truly own it. Play a song or read a book on any platform, sell it on a secondary market, or pass it along to a friend - it’s all yours with no vendor lock-in! It's a revolutionary concept that is changing the way we think about ownership and control in the digital age.
