# Decentralization

In the context of Web3, the term _“decentralized”_ is commonly used. Generally speaking, this term goes hand-in-hand with another term: _“blockchain”_ - a technology we’ll soon formally introduce - which typically operate on decentralized systems; so let’s take a moment to properly define it, and outline its advantages compared to _“centralized”_ systems.

> A decentralized system consists of a **network of participants** that operate and make decisions collaboratively **without relying on a central authority or control**. In such a system, each participant has equal rights and responsibilities, and the consensus of the network determines the outcome of any decision or action.

In the above definition, participants can either be real people, or computers (or nodes) as is more relevant to this article. Each node is owned and maintained by different, independent parties that are geographically diverse.

### Why it Matters

Public, global decentralized systems provide several benefits, such as:

* **Increased security**, as there is no single point of failure or control that can be targeted or exploited by malicious actors
* **Increased transparency**, since these systems are publicly visible
* **Resistance to censorship and corruption**, since the network operates with multiple participants on a global scale, and no single entity can shut it down
* **Borderless operation**, again due to the globally dispersed network
* **Promotes democracy**, since all participants in the network can access and influence the network
