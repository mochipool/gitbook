# Type of Wallets

### Hot Wallets

Hot wallets are online wallets that are connected to the internet. They are software-based applications that are convenient and easy to use, but also more susceptible to hacking and security breaches. Examples of hot wallets include Metamask, Nami, and Flint.

### Cold Wallets

Cold wallets, on the other hand, are offline wallets that are **not** connected to the internet and can either be in the form of software or hardware. They are more secure than hot wallets because they are not susceptible to online attacks.

* Hardware (HD) wallets are USB-like devices which store and encrypt your wallet on a physical device. They are very secure, and the most resistant to hacks. Examples include HD wallets like Ledger and Trezor.
* Cold software wallets are called air-gapped wallets, and while offline, your wallet is still stored on a computer. If physically hacked, you can lose your assets.
