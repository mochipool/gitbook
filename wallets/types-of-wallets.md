# Types of Wallets

There are two main types of wallets: hot wallets and cold wallets.

#### Hot Wallets

Hot wallets are online wallets that are connected to the internet. They are convenient and easy to use, but they are also more susceptible to hacking and security breaches. Examples of hot wallets include Metamask, MyEtherWallet, and Coinbase Wallet.

#### Cold Wallets

Cold wallets, on the other hand, are offline wallets that are not connected to the internet. They are more secure than hot wallets because they are not susceptible to online attacks. Examples of cold wallets include hardware wallets like Ledger and Trezor.
