# What are Wallets?

In traditional finance, a wallet is a physical or digital container that **holds money or other assets**, credit cards, cash, your driverâ€™s license, maybe even a photo of a loved one. Similarly, a Web3 wallet is a digital container that holds your **digital assets**, such as cryptocurrencies, tokens, and NFTs. It allows you to send, receive, manage and interact with your digital assets on the blockchain, just like a traditional wallet allows you to manage your physical money.

If you want to participate in the decentralized world of Web3, you need a wallet. It is the only way to send, receive, and manage digital assets on the blockchain. Without a wallet, you cannot buy, sell, or trade cryptocurrencies, tokens, or NFTs. They are an essential tool and act as the gateway for anyone interested in Web3.
