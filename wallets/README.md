# Wallets

Wallets are an essential tool for those interested in interacting with Web3 In traditional finance, a wallet is a _physical container_ that **holds money or other assets**, credit cards, cash, your driver’s license, maybe even a photo of a loved one. Similarly, a Web3 wallet is a _digital container_ that holds your **digital assets**, such as cryptocurrencies, tokens, and NFTs. It allows you to **send, receive, manage and interact** with your digital assets on the blockchain, just like a traditional wallet allows you to manage your physical money. They act as your gateway to interacting with Web3 applications, the same way as browsers act as your gateway to the internet (Web2).

## Types of Wallets

### Hot Wallets

Hot wallets are online wallets that are connected to the internet. They are software-based applications that are convenient and easy to use, but also more susceptible to hacking and security breaches. Examples of hot wallets include Metamask, Nami, and Flint.

### Cold Wallets

Cold wallets, on the other hand, are offline wallets that are **not** connected to the internet. They can either be in the form of software or hardware, are more secure than hot wallets because they are not susceptible to online attacks.

* Hardware (HD) wallets are USB-like devices which store and encrypt your wallet on a physical device. They are very secure, and the most resistant to hacks. Examples include HD wallets like Ledger and Trezor.
* Cold software wallets are called air-gapped wallets, and while offline, your wallet is still stored on a computer. If physically hacked, you can lose your assets.

## Safety & Responsibility

One thing to note is that unless you’re using a centralized service like an exchange, you are responsible for keeping your wallet safe and secure. This ties in with the concept of self-custody previously mentioned; if you misplace or lose your keys, or if they get compromised, there is no centralized authority that can help you. Like physical wallets, it's your responsibility to ensure that it doesn't get lost or stolen.
