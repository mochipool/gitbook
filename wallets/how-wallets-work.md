# How Wallets Work

Web3 wallets use cryptographic technology to interact with the blockchain. Every wallet has a unique public address and a private key. The public address acts like a bank account number, while the private key acts as the password or signature that allows you to access and manage your digital assets.

When you want to send digital assets, you initiate a transaction from your wallet by signing it with your private key. The transaction is then broadcast to the network and validated by the consensus mechanism we discussed earlier. Once the transaction is confirmed, the digital assets are transferred to the recipient's wallet.
