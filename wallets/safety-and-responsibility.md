# Safety & Responsibility

One thing to note is that in Web3, unless youâ€™re using a centralized service like an exchange, you are responsible for keeping your wallet safe and secure. This ties in with the concept of self-custody previously mentioned. If you misplace or lose your keys, or if they get compromised, there is no centralized authority that can help you.
