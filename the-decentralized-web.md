# The Decentralized Web

Now that you have a basic understanding of self-custody, digital ownership and decentralization, we can finally jump into the magic that is Web3! But what _exactly_ is it? To talk about Web3, we should first outline the problems that it solves - those of the current internet, Web2.

## Web 2

Web2 is the current version of the internet that we use every day, which encourages more online social interaction. It's characterized by centralized platforms and services like Facebook, Twitter, and Google, which control and profit from our data.

* **Centralization**: Web2 relies on a few powerful companies that control most of the data, content, and services on the internet. This creates risks of censorship, manipulation, privacy breaches, and monopolies.
* **Lack of trust**: Web2 users have to trust intermediaries to verify transactions, store data, and provide services. This creates inefficiencies, fees, and vulnerabilities.
* **Lack of value creation**: Web2 users generate a lot of value for platforms through their data and content, but they do not get rewarded or own their digital assets.

## Web 3

Web3 is the next generation of the internet. It proposes to solve the problems of Web2 by leveraging decentralized technologies that enable users to interact directly with each other without intermediaries, own their data and digital assets, and participate in new forms of value creation.&#x20;

Remember those ideas of self-custody and digital ownership?

> Web3 is an _**idea**_ for a new generation of the internet, which aims to give users more control over their data and content, and create new ways of interacting online. To accomplish this, it uses _**decentralized**_ technologies like blockchain and cryptocurrencies, which can operate without reliance on a centralized authority.
